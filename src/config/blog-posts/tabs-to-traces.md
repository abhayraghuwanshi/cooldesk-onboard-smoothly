# From Tabs to Traces: How Modern Browsing Actually Happens

The concept of "browsing" is outdated. We don't just graze on information anymore; we research, compare, transit, and synthesize. We leave behind what we should call "browsing traces."

A trace is more than a history entry. It’s the sequence of Google searches, the three open documentation pages, and the AI chat that finally gave you the answer. In the current browser model, these are all treated as isolated events. In reality, they are a single thread of work.

Modern productivity is about managing these traces. If you can't reconstruct the path you took to arrive at a conclusion, you haven't really acquired knowledge—you've just found a temporary answer.

Cooldesk is built around this shift from tabs to traces. By capturing the metadata and the connections between your links, it allows you to pick up exactly where you left off, even weeks later. It turns a fragmented browsing session into a persistent knowledge base.
