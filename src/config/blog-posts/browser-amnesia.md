# Your Browser Has Amnesia — Here’s How People Are Fixing It

Modern browsers are marvels of engineering, yet they possess a fundamental flaw: they have perfect memory for history but zero memory for intent. 

You can find a URL you visited three Tuesdays ago, but you can’t easily find the train of thought that led you there. We treat history like a ledger, but browsing is a journey. When you close a tab, the context—the "why" behind the "what"—evaporates. 

This is why traditional bookmarks feel like a digital graveyard. They store the address, but they forget the reason you wanted to live there. 

A new wave of tools is shifting the focus from history to state. Instead of just recording where you went, they capture the trace of your workflow. Cooldesk treats your browser as an extension of your working memory. By organizing links not just by time, but by context and intent, it gives your browser the one thing it’s been missing: a long-term memory for your projects, not just your clicks.
