# The Hidden Cost of Tab Hoarding (It’s Not What You Think)

We usually talk about tab hoarding in terms of RAM and CPU usage. But the real cost is measured in decision fatigue. 

Every open tab is an unfinished task screaming for attention. When you look at a row of fifty favicons, your brain is performing a micro-assessment of each one: Is this still relevant? Should I read this now? Am I going to lose this if I close it?

This constant visual noise drains your cognitive battery before you’ve even started working. We keep tabs open because we don't trust our tools to find them again. It's a survival tactic for a broken information system.

The solution isn't a better tab manager; it's a better recall system. When you can trust that a link is preserved with its full context and intent, the need to keep it "visible" disappears. Cooldesk allows you to clear the clutter without losing the connection, turning your browser from a crowded waiting room into a focused workspace.
