# The Best Dock Apps for Mac (2026): An Honest List

Want more from the macOS Dock: window previews, a taskbar, folders, a vertical bar? Here's an honest comparison of DockDoor, uBar, ActiveDock, Sidebar, HyperDock and CoolDesk, including what each one does better than the rest.

The macOS Dock is beautiful and deliberately simple. That simplicity is the problem when you have three windows of the same app and can't tell which is which, when you use two monitors, or when you came from Windows and miss the taskbar. Dock apps fill those gaps.

They come in three flavors. **Dock enhancers** keep Apple's Dock and add what it lacks, mainly window previews. **Dock replacements** swap it for something different, like a taskbar or a vertical bar. **Workspace docks** care less about looks and more about showing what belongs to the work you're doing right now.

Full disclosure: **we make one of the tools on this list** (CoolDesk). So the usual rule applies: for every tool, including ours, we say what it's genuinely best at *and* where another tool beats it.

## The short version

| Tool | Price | Type | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DockDoor | Free, open source (Pro $20) | Dock enhancer | Window previews and Alt+Tab, free |
| uBar | $39 (14-day trial) | Dock replacement | A Windows-style taskbar on the Mac |
| ActiveDock 2 | About $20 | Dock replacement | A customizable Dock with a Start-menu launcher |
| Sidebar | €19.99 once, or €12.50/year | Dock replacement | A vertical Dock on the side of the screen |
| HyperDock | Paid | Dock enhancer | Not recommended in 2026 |
| CoolDesk | Free | Workspace dock + sidebar | A dock that shows your current project |

## First: tweak the Dock you have

Before you install anything, two free tweaks fix the most common complaints:

- **Move it.** System Settings → Desktop & Dock → *Position on screen*: Left or Right frees up vertical space on a laptop.
- **Make auto-hide instant.** By default the Dock waits before sliding in. Run `defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock` in Terminal to remove the delay, or `defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock` to undo it.

## DockDoor

DockDoor is a free, open-source (GPL-3.0) app that adds what most people miss from Windows: hover over a Dock icon and see previews of all that app's windows, including minimized and hidden ones. It also adds Alt+Tab switching between individual windows, previews in ⌘-Tab, music controls and more. It has thousands of GitHub stars and its popularity is growing fast. A paid DockDoor Pro is available, but the free version has no paywall.

**What it's best at:** window previews, for free. If you only install one Dock app, make it this one.

**Where others beat it:** it enhances Apple's Dock rather than replacing it, so you still get Apple's layout and its single-monitor behavior. For a taskbar, look at uBar.

## uBar

uBar has turned the Mac Dock into a Windows-style taskbar for over a decade. Each open window gets its own button, with live previews on hover, grouping you control, a bar per screen on multi-monitor setups, and themes. It can sit on any screen edge. Version 5 adds a command bar where you type (or say "Hey uBar") to open apps and arrange windows.

**What it's best at:** being a taskbar. If you switched from Windows and the Dock never clicked, uBar is the most mature answer.

**Where others beat it:** price. At $39 it's the most expensive tool here, and uBar 5 requires macOS 26 Tahoe or later. If you just want window previews, DockDoor does that free.

## ActiveDock 2

ActiveDock 2 replaces the Dock with a more capable one: app groups and folders, a Start-menu-style launcher, window previews and deep appearance customization, while still looking like a Mac Dock. It's sold as a one-time licence of about $20.

**What it's best at:** a Dock that looks familiar but does more, especially if you liked Launchpad-style folders.

**Where others beat it:** it's updated less visibly than DockDoor or uBar, and we couldn't confirm official support for the newest macOS releases. Use the trial on your Mac before you buy.

## Sidebar

Sidebar moves your Dock to a vertical bar on the edge of the screen, where widescreen displays have room to spare. Hover an app for previews of its windows, group apps into Stacks, and use the Sidebar button for an app launcher. It runs on macOS 13 Ventura or newer, on one or more screens.

**What it's best at:** a vertical Dock done properly. Read more in our [sidebar apps comparison](/blog/best-sidebar-apps-mac-windows).

**Where others beat it:** it's paid, and it's about apps and windows only. Browser tabs and project files don't live in it.

## HyperDock (skip it)

HyperDock was the original Mac window-preview app, and it still turns up in older "best of" lists. It hasn't had a significant update in years, it's built for Intel Macs and runs only through Rosetta on Apple Silicon, and users report problems on newer macOS versions. **DockDoor does the same job, free and actively maintained.**

## CoolDesk (that's us)

CoolDesk is a free project workspace for Mac and Windows, and its dock is built around one idea: show what belongs to the work you're doing right now. **⌘+Shift+D** switches between three layouts:

- **Full window**: the complete CoolDesk workspace view.
- **Bottom bar**: a dock strip that sits above Apple's Dock. One view shows everything open right now (running apps *and* browser tabs). The other shows the current project's links, apps, folders and files. Drop a file from Finder onto the bar to add it to the project.
- **Side dock**: a slim handle on the screen edge. Hover or click and a sidebar slides in with your workspaces, tabs and notes. It works over full-screen apps and on whichever display your cursor is on.

Folder chips are developer-aware: they show the project's stack logo, the git branch and whether it has uncommitted changes, and when a dev server is running.

**What it's best at:** context. Every other dock here shows the same apps no matter what you're working on. CoolDesk's changes with your project, and puts browser tabs next to desktop apps. It's free, needs no account, and keeps everything on your device.

**Where others beat it:** it doesn't replace Apple's Dock or add window previews to it. Use DockDoor for that (the two work fine together). It has no taskbar mode like uBar, and fewer looks than ActiveDock. It's also the youngest tool here.

## Which one should you pick?

- **"I want window previews like Windows, free"** → DockDoor
- **"I want a real taskbar"** → uBar
- **"I want a Dock with folders and a Start menu"** → ActiveDock 2
- **"I want my Dock on the side of the screen"** → Sidebar
- **"I want a dock that shows my current project's apps, files and tabs"** → [CoolDesk](/)

**Try CoolDesk free:** [download for Mac or Windows](/api/download). No account needed, and it takes about a minute to set up. Press ⌘+Shift+D to try each layout.

## FAQ

**What's the best free Dock app for Mac?**
DockDoor, for window previews and Alt+Tab. CoolDesk is also free if you want a dock and sidebar organized by project.

**Can I get Windows-style window previews on the Mac Dock?**
Yes. DockDoor adds them free, and uBar, ActiveDock and Sidebar include them too.

**Can I replace the Dock with a taskbar?**
Yes. uBar is the established option, with a button per window, previews and per-monitor bars.

**Can I have a different Dock on each monitor?**
Apple's Dock follows you between screens but shows the same apps. uBar can give each screen its own bar, and Sidebar can run on several screens.

**Is HyperDock still worth it?**
No. It hasn't been meaningfully updated in years and runs only under Rosetta on Apple Silicon. DockDoor replaces it for free.
