# What Happens to Links Shared in Chats After 30 Days?

We live in a world of ephemeral communication. We share critical resources in Slack, WhatsApp, and Zoom chats, and then they vanish into the scroll. 

Three weeks later, when you actually need that API documentation or that research paper, you’re stuck scrolling through hundreds of messages or trying to remember which channel it was in. The link hasn't disappeared, but its accessibility has. 

Shared links have a lifecycle that current tools ignore. They are born in a conversation, used briefly, and then buried.

Cooldesk acts as a bridge between your conversations and your long-term knowledge. By making it easy to pull links from chat environments into a persistent, searchable workspace, it ensures that shared knowledge doesn't have an expiration date. It turns a chaotic stream of shared links into an organized library for your team.
