# The Problem Isn’t Bookmarks — It’s Recall

Storage was solved years ago. We can save millions of links effortlessly. The problem is that we can’t find them when it matters. 

A bookmark is a static pointer. But information is dynamic. You might save a link for its technical specifications today, but need it for its pricing information six months from now. If your search tool only looks at the title and URL, you’re relying on your own memory to bridge the gap.

"Recall" is the ability to bring back information based on its relevance to your current state, not just its name.

This is the core philosophy of Cooldesk. It doesn't just store links; it facilitates recall. By using LLM-powered context and intelligent search that understands the intent of your workspaces, it ensures that the knowledge you've saved is actually accessible. You shouldn't have to remember where you put it; your browser should know why you need it.
