# Why Your New Tab Is the Most Wasted Screen in Tech

The "New Tab" page is the most frequently visited screen in your digital life. You probably open it fifty to a hundred times a day. And yet, for most people, it’s a blank void or a collection of generic shortcuts.

It’s the digital equivalent of prime real estate in Manhattan being used as a parking lot. 

Every time you open a new tab, you are at a transition point. You are finishing one task and starting another. This is the moment where you are most vulnerable to distraction—and where you most need your context.

Cooldesk reclaims this space. Instead of a dead end, your new tab becomes a dashboard for your active projects. It shows you where you were, what you were working on, and what you need next. By turning the most wasted screen in tech into a central nervous system for your browsing, it eliminates the "starting friction" that kills productivity.
