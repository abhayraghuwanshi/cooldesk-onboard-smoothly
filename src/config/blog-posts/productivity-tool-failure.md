# Why Every Productivity Tool Fails After Week One

The graveyard of productivity apps is filled with tools that required too much "maintenance." If a tool asks you to change your habits, categorize your life, or learn a new syntax, it’s already losing the battle for your attention.

Most tools fail because they demand an upfront investment of effort that busy people can't afford. You spend the first week setting up folders and tags, and the second week realizing you don't have time to keep them updated.

True productivity tools are "zero-effort." They should work silently in the background, capturing value without asking for permission.

Cooldesk is designed for this reality. There is no migration, no structure to learn, and no friction. It integrates into the one screen you already open fifty times a day: the new tab. By meeting you where you already are, it becomes a part of your workflow instead of another chore on your to-do list.
