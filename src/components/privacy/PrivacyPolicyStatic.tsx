These are counts and event types only — it does <strong>not</strong> record the text you type, your form values, keystrokes, or page content. Used to rank and auto-categorise URLs so Spotlight and workspaces surface the sites that matter to you.</li>

                            CoolDesk includes an optional <strong>Spaces</strong> feature for sharing links, notes, saved items, and a shared "space context" (a goal, today's focus, and notices) with people you choose.

                            A Space is opened with a <strong>shared secret phrase</strong>. That phrase is the key: on your device it is turned into a room ID and an encryption key — the phrase itself is never uploaded.

                            <li><strong>Peer-to-peer &amp; end-to-end encrypted.</strong> Space data syncs directly between members' devices over WebRTC and is encrypted with the key derived from your secret phrase.</li>
                            <li><strong>Signaling server.</strong> A lightweight signaling server helps members discover and connect to each other. It sees only the Space's connection ID — never your decrypted content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relay servers.</strong> To connect across firewalls and networks, WebRTC may route traffic through third-party STUN/TURN relays (e.g. Google STUN and Open Relay). Because the data is end-to-end encrypted, these relays only ever carry ciphertext.</li>
                            <li><strong>No central store.</strong> CoolDesk does not operate a server that stores your Space content — it lives only on members' devices.</li>

                            You stay in control: you can pause syncing for a Space at any time, and leaving a Space stops sharing your data with it. Only the data you put into a Space is shared — your personal tabs, history, and private workspaces are never shared unless you explicitly add them.
